# Code-Samples
This repository is a collection of some of the code that I have written in the past.

## Projects Included
* [C++] **Hwk3.Try2**: This project was meant to simulate the functions of a basic airliner. It tracks crew members, flights, and planes with vectors, and includes use of `time.h`, file input and output, basic menu operations on the command line, and more.
* [C++] **Hwk1**: This project was meant to manage a group of students, and involved a lot of memory pre-allocation, command line I/O, and memory manipulation. The imported files `student.h` and `bubble.h` were provided by the instructor and are not included.
* [C] **Lab1Assignment**: This project was similar to Hwk1, but used file I/O instead of command line I/O. Wide usage of `printf`.
* [C++] **Lab2B**: This project simulates a bank account, uses `scanf` for command line input rather than `cin` to get more complex data entry. The imported file `BankAccount.h` was provided by the instructor and is not included.
* [C++] **Lab10Assignment**: This was a small project that uses `printf`, `scanf`, and recursion to compute a specific set of numbers. Mostly an exercise in recursion.
* [Python] **Data Structures (All Python files)**: From-scratch implementations of stacks, queues, singly-linked lists, and hash tables, with manual unit tests included.
